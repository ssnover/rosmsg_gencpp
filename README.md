# rosmsg_gencpp
This project is inspired by [genmsg](https://github.com/ros/genmsg), a tool for
generating C++ header files based on ROS message types definitions. This repository
will support both an executable form with a similar set of arguments to the tool
that its based on and a library form for integration into Rust-based tools.

This project is very much work-in-progress. It probably won't be on crates.io
until its had some considerable amount of usage in a real ROS codebase.
